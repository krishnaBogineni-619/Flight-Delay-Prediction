# Flight Delay Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict flight delays using various machine learning algorithms and to compare their performance. The project uses data from airlines, airports, and flight records, focusing on features like **ARRIVAL_TIME** and **ARRIVAL_DELAY**. After building predictive models, visualizations are generated to compare the actual delays with the predicted delays.

## Datasets

The following datasets are used:

- **airlines.csv**: Contains details about the airlines operating the flights.
- **airports.csv**: Contains information about airports, such as codes and locations.
- **flights.csv**: Contains flight data, including times, delays, and associated airports.

### Key Features

- **ARRIVAL_TIME**: The scheduled arrival time of the flight.
- **ARRIVAL_DELAY**: The delay (in minutes) of the flight's arrival, which is the target variable.
- Additional features such as departure times, flight distance, weather data, and more from the flights dataset.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether a flight will be delayed and by how much. We will also compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms and visualize the differences between the actual and predicted delays.

## Libraries and Tools

This project leverages the following libraries and tools:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms, including:
  - **Linear Regression**: Basic regression model.
  - **Decision Trees**: Decision-based model.
  - **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning model.
  - **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced ensemble model for better accuracy.
- **XGBoost**: An efficient implementation of gradient boosting.
- **Warnings**: For handling warnings in code.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the datasets.
   - Merge relevant datasets (airlines, airports, flights).
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Feature engineering (e.g., creating time-related features like hour, day of the week, etc.).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize patterns in flight delays.
   - Analyze relationships between delays and features such as distance, departure time, and weather.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Train several machine learning models to predict flight delays, including:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Trees**
     - **Random Forest**
     - **Gradient Boosting**

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Compare models using metrics such as:
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - R-squared
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted delays for each model.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Plot graphs comparing actual delays with predicted delays.
   - Generate insights from the visualizations to understand model performance.

## Results

- **Prediction Accuracy**: Summarize the accuracy of each model in predicting flight delays.
- **Comparison of Algorithms**: Highlight which machine learning algorithm performed best based on the evaluation metrics.
- **Visualization**: Include plots that show actual delays versus predicted delays.
